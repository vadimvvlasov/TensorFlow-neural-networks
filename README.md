# TensorFlow-neural-networks
Build neural networks in TensorFlow framework
steps:
- Initialize variables
- Start your own session
- Train algorithms 
- Implement a Neural Network

# Convolutional Neural Networks
Helper functions that implements a three-layer ConvNet in Tensorflow:
    CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED
The model consists of the following steps:
- create placeholders
- initialize parameters
- forward propagate
- compute the cost
- create an optimizer
